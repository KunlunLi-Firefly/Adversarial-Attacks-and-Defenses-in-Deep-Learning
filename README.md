# Adversarial-Attacks-and-Defenses-in-Deep-Learning
This project explores adversarial attacks and defenses in the context of deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Adversarial attacks attempt to mislead machine learning models by introducing small perturbations to the input data. The project implements several types of attacks and defenses:
